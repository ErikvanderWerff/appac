## Summary




## Introduction

The effect that ambient pressure has on an FID signal was first reported by Bocek et al.
in 1969 [1]. The authors claim that ionization efficiency is strongly dependent on pressure
and that normal changes in atmospheric pressure can result in changes to as much
as ±5% of the value measured at 1 atm.

US patent 4,512,181 [2] describes a procedure for correcting the impact that atmospheric 
pressure variations have on the output of a chromatographic analyzer. This correction 
should be determined in conjunction with the calibration of the instrument. The authors 
of the patent quantificate the pressure effect as follows:

$$ \frac {C_m} {C_a} = 1 + M \left( \frac{P_a}{P_c} - 1 \right) $$
where:

$P_a$:  atmospheric pressure at the time the sample was measured

$P_c$:  atmospheric pressure at calibration time

$C_m$:  measured analyzer output at pressure $P_a$

$C_a$:  analyzer output as if the sample had been measured at $P_c$

$M$:    the slope of plot $\frac{C_m}{C_a}$ as a function of $\frac{P_a}{P_c}$

The correction of the detector response (peak area or peak height) of a peak is given as follows:

$$ Y^{\#} = \frac{Y}{1 + M \left( \frac{P_a}{P_c} - 1 \right)} $$
where:

$Y^{\#}$: corrected analyzer output 

$Y$:   measured analyzer output

The pressure artifact had caught the attention of an instrument manufacturer who 
invented electronic pressure control (EPC), which tries to remedy the problem by  
measuring atmospheric pressure and stabilizing pressures and flows of an instrument accordingly
[3]. Despite these efforts the manufacturer still specifies an area precision at 
better than 1% RSD [4]. This figure is in accordance with the long-run variances 
obtained by our experiments without applying a correction.

The pressure artifact seems to have been largely overlooked in the literature since then. 
Barwick does not mention atmospheric pressure as a source of uncertainty in flame 
ionization detection in her excellent and comprehensive review [5]. Nor does this 
topic  appear in a standard for the testing of flame ionization detectors [6]. 
A pressure influence on FID response is even expressly rejected in another 
standard [7].

## Details

### Theory of the flame ionization detector

Theory is that an FID is a mass sensitive detector. An atmospheric 
hydrogen-air flame forms its core. Any organic compound that reaches the flame produces ions
in amounts which are almost perfectly proportional to the mass of carbon atoms reaching the flame [8].

Technically speaking, the FID measures the rate at which these ions are produced 
and subsequently collected. Its output voltage V is expected to be proportional 
to the ion formation rate $\dot{n}$ and the charge collection efficiency $\eta_c$.

$$V \propto \eta_c \dot{n} = \eta_c(P, \theta)   \left[] r_{br}(\theta) \times \frac{x_CM_C}{M_G} \right] \left[ F_d \times \frac{P M_G}{RT} \right]$$
where:

$r_{br}$: branching ratio; total ion formation rate divided by the overall reaction (burning) rate

$\theta$: adiabatic flame temperature

$x_C$: mole fraction of carbon in the feed gas

$F_d$: detector feed gas flow rate (fuel gas + air + makeup gas + column effluent)

$M_G$: average molar mass of the detector feed gas

$M_C$: molar mass of carbon

$P_d$: detector pressure

$R$: gas constant

$T$: temperature

The expression in the left square bracket gives the mass ratio of ions formed in the burning 
feed gas, while the expression in the right square bracket represents the mass flow rate into
the flame.

Ions and electrons are produced in equal amounts. An inhomogeneous electrostatic field 
spreads between collector and jet. The collector is a tube which is aligned in a 
small distance above the jet. The collector is negatively charged with respect 
to the jet and thus collects the positively charged ions, while the jet collects 
the electrons. This produces a small current which is amplified and converted to 
voltage in the detector electronics. Ions and electrons that have not been captured 
recombine so that there remains a net zero charge. 

It is well known that an FID will saturate at high analyte loadings. This saturation 
is caused by a space charge effect. When a massive amount of ions is generated, 
these ions screen the electrostatic field and thus slow down the migration speed 
of the ions. Consequently, ions and electrons have more time to recombine and the  
sensitivity of the detector decreases.

Pressure affects flame geometry, but in a complicated way. Flame speed, i.e. the 
rate at which the flame front expands, decreases with increasing pressure. At the 
same time flame stretch, which measures the rate at which the area of a flame 
surface grows, increases. In simple words: As the pressure increases, flame height 
increases and flame width decreases. 

When the flame length increases, it is partly located inside the collector tube,
where the electrostatic field strength and the local charge collection efficiency 
are zero, cf. Fig. 1.

Our measurements indicate that FID response typically changes a rate between -0.7% 
and -0.8% per 10 hPa per 10 hPa of pressure increase. A rate of -1.0% would indicate that 
detector response and pressure are inversely proportional.

### Theory of the thermal conductivity detector

Theory says that a TCD is concentration sensitive detector. The thermal conductivity 
detector has its applications in gas analytics and process GC for the detection 
of permanent gases and light hydrocarbons.

According to van Es et al. [9] the output voltage V of a TCD is given as:

$$ V = I R_0 \alpha x 
       \left[ A - \frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_2 B} \right] 
       \left( T - T_w \right) 
       \frac{1 + \alpha T}{1 + \alpha T_w}$$
where:

$I$: filament current

$T$: filament temperature

$T_w$: block temperature

$R_0$: filament resistance at 0°C

$\alpha$: temperature coefficient of the sample

$x$: molar fraction of the sample

$\lambda_1$: thermal conductivity of carrier gas

$\lambda_2$: thermal conductivity of sample

$A, B$: constants

Van Es et al. [9] conclude: The thermal conductivity of carrier gas and component 
are independent of pressure at least down to 0.1 bar. Consequently the TCD sensitivity 
increases inversely proportional with pressure.

The above equation suggests that the response of a TCD is inversely proportional to
pressure. Our measurements typically show that the sensitivity of a TCD changes at
a rate of about -0.5% per 10 hPa of pressure increase, which is only half of the
expected rate.

### Pressure effects on sample introduction

Pressure is known to affect the response of an instrument when gaseous samples are 
concerned: The sample amount is proportional to the pressure inside the sample 
loop. Accordingly this applies to the amount of the analyte and the peak area. 

![Fig. 3: Schematic of a gas sampling valve (Source: www.vici.com)][Fig 3.]{width=100%}

Please note that pressure has a positive effect on sample amount while its effect 
on detector response is a negative one. Injecting a gaseous sample at atmospheric 
pressure somewhat counteracts the effect atmospheric pressure has on the respective 
detector. 

Split injection is a basic injection technique in gas chromatography. During a 
split injection, a major part of the sample is vented from the inlet to the atmosphere while only 
a minor part is introduced into the column. The split ratio is set by the user in 
the analytical method. For the configuration of a S/SL inlet, see Fig. 4. With EPC
split and column flows are not supposed to be dependent on atmospheric pressure.

## Statistical model

Although this correction method is identical to the one proposed here, it was of 
limited practical value and to the author's knowledge has never been commercialized.
This solution is only applicable for short time periods, because the impacted of
atmospheric pressure on the analyzer response is partially masked by other artifacts 
generated by the instrument itself, such as bias, trend and drift.

The objective of our approach is to quantitatively separate these artifacts from 
each other and to compensate for each one individually.
